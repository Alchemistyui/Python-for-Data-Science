3 main parts of UNIX: shell, kernal, programs
shell is the interface btw the user and the kernal, act as a command line interpreter
command: programs that are excecuted by the shell
everything in UNIX is represented by a file or a process!
process: an excecuting program identified by a unique process identifier(PID).
file: a collection of data and are organized in a directory structure. 
directory: special files that contain other files.
files are organized in a hierarchical structure.(tree structure)
-------------
path: separate directories by /
absolute path: start at root(root is /)
relative path: start at working directory
(./ refers to working dir, .. refer to level above)
-------------
TILDE character(~): refer to the special user's home directory(dir under users)
pwd: command to check(print) the working dir
ls: list files and folders; options(-l: display in long form; -a: show hidden files)
cd: change dir
cat: show the content of text files(print the content)
man: manual pages; man ls: lookup documentation for ls
-------------
Utility Commands
mkdir: create dir

stdout: usually to the terminal, can be switch to file or process
stderr: usually to the terminal
cp: copy(cp source destination)
mv: move(mv source destination)
-------------
Redirect Standard IO
redirect stdin to file: command < file
redirect stdout to file(rewrite): command > file / command 1> file
redirect stdout to file(append): command >> file
redirect stderr to file: command 2> file
redirect stderr to file(append): command 2>> file
redirect stdout & stderr: command 2> file1 > file2
redirect stdout & stderr to the same file: command > file 2>&1
-------------
cat: show the content of text files(print the content)
more: fit the content in the shell, press space to go through, Q to quit
sort: sort file content by alphabetical order(sort a.txt > b.txt)
uniq: get the unique lines of the file
wc: word count(opt: -l count lines)
